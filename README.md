## Synopsis

ARFilters is an Android implementation of real-time camera filters for Android VR. Just aquire a Google Cardboard viewer or some other VR viewer for Android and your vision should be augmented with shaders in real-time provided your hardware is fast enough. Note that you may need to modify your viewer in order to ensure that the rear-facing camera is not obstructed. If your viewer's trigger does not work then you will have to tap the screen of your device to switch filters.

## Motivation

This project was developed by Taylor Jackle Spriggs for his honours project credit at Carleton University.

## Installation

Import the project into Android Studio. Gradle will install all of the dependencies.

## Testing

This application has only been tested on the Sony Xperia Z5 with Google Cardboard V1. The magnetic cardboard trigger does not work with this device.
