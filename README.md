## Synopsis

ARFilters is an Android implementation of real-time camera filters for Android VR. Just aquire a Google Cardboard viewer or some other VR viewer for Android and your vision should be augmented with shaders in real-time provided your hardware is fast enough. Note that you may need to modify your viewer in order to ensure that the rear-facing camera is not obstructed. If your viewer's trigger does not work then you will hav to tap the screen of your device to switch filters.
